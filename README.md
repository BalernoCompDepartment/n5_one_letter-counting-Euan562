# A simple first program to get used to Repl.it and submission

A student wants to know how many letters are in a word (or series of words) and has asked you to write a program to work it out for them

### The Task

Write a program that asks the user to enter some text and then tell them how many characters are in the String they entered (including spaces and punctuation)

this program makes use of the String predefined function .length() this returns the number of characters in a String

**example of uses**

Stirng name = "James";

int length = name.length(); // this will store 5 the number of letters

## Your Task

Write the Java in Main.java to take in some words from the user at the Keyboard, calculate how many letters there are, display how many letters are in the word

## The Algorithm Design

**Step 1:** ask user for the words and store as message\
**Step 2:**	store the number of the letters as numberLetters\
**Step 3:**	display "There are " + numberLetters + " in " + message

Test your program and submitt through a version control commit!
